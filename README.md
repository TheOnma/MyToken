# MyToken

MyToken is an ERC20-compliant token built using Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries. This project includes smart contract deployment scripts and a suite of tests to ensure the functionality of the token.

## Requirements

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for managing JavaScript dependencies (if needed).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MyToken
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

## Usage

### Compile the Contracts

To compile the Solidity contracts, run:

```bash
forge build
```

### Run Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
forge test
```

### Deploy the Contract

#### Local Deployment

To deploy the contract locally using Anvil:

1. Start Anvil in one terminal:

   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

2. Deploy the contract in another terminal:

   ```bash
   make deploy
   ```

#### Sepolia Testnet Deployment

To deploy on the Sepolia testnet, ensure you have the following environment variables set: `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `ACCOUNT`, `SENDER`, `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`.

Then run:

```bash
make deploy-sepolia
```
